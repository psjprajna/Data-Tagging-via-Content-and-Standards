We are using five datasets for our analysis which includes BBC, Aljazeera, CNBC, CNN, Japan Times.
Data cleaning is done based on:
- Checking null values using isna()
- Checking standard and non standard missing values (spaces, NA, na etc)
- Checking duplicate values in url column
- Validating if link is valid/expired

After cleaning datasets are available in this [folder](https://github.com/psjprajna/Data-Tagging-via-Content-and-Standards/tree/main/Data%20Cleaning/Datasets_after_cleaning).
