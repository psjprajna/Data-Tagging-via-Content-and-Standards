The extraction script is run on the clean data and executes the following:

- The extraction of published date and title from clean text generated by HTML scripts retrieved from URLs.
- The extraction of 'person', 'organization' and 'places' entity tags from HTML scripts retrieved from URLs.

After extraction from clean datasets, the datasets are available in this [folder](https://github.com/psjprajna/Data-Tagging-via-Content-and-Standards/tree/main/Data%20Extraction/Datasets_after_extraction).
